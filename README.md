This repository contains the python implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms 
1. Value Iteration
2. Policy Iteration

Explanation of the files
`gridWorld.py`: Plots a grid world, `O`, of dimensions `n`, `m`, as well as a table in the terminal with the value function at each grid celll (state).
                The grid plot shows the start and final states and, given a sequence of legal states defining a path, it plots the path in the grid environment.
`smallGrid.py`: 
`mediumGrid.py`:
